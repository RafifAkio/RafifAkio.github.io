In a dark place where someone hardly to sleep. At the bed someone getting remembered of the memories he has. Then he try to sleep but hardly could. He has a glimps of bad thoughts and flashbacks on his head. He’s give up and awake from his bed. He grab a chair and put it in front of his window. He sit on it and think with rubbing his eyes. 

Then he got a memory of the horrible things he do and that he face, like getting rejected by his lover, failed at class, failed to be the best friend to his friend while slowly back and forth of the distress of his face with he’s flashbacks. And at the end, he sees the last his mom or dad faces and just gone with the sound of a car crash. Then he sees his legs, one of them is “gone.” Then he remembers he almost has a suicidal thoughts on him at the time. With the loneliness comeback, he needs to remember that life isn’t always the way he thought it be. He need to remember this “a test of life,” proving that’s anything can possible, in a good way, and a bad way.   

Then get up and back and forth of walking. Then he sees someones in his bed and that someones is a woman, his wife and his baby. With the reality of that, he has a smile on his face. Then he remember again the good things that he need to pull into to get that life, not on terror, but on happiness. He has a deep breath and goes to balcony of the room and start to stare outsidehe. He starts to remember the process of fixing that problems, getting good at studies, get a new lover, resolve his former lover, say sorry and fixing the problems to his friends, and accepting that life and death is inevitable and his parents Is one of those or in between. With a smile comeback to his face while remembering the good thoughts on him.

Then someone goes to him and says “Dear, are you okay?” said someone. “Yeah, I’m just a little bit of a thought process” said him to his wife. “Don’t worry we’re in this together, no matter what is ahead of us.” Said his wife with a smile on her face to him while grabbing his hand. Then he smiles. Both of them then close the balcony. And finally he can rest with his love and family of his life.`;
