      let storyText = `In a distant word where the light never touch and darkness upon the land except a “blue aura of behind.” Nobody knows where’s that aura coming from, they’re only know that it’s there. But the aura cannot touch to every land and every light cannot be lit. The people of the land rarely speak and only in a certain situation. But for some of them have the ability to see in the dark, some can hear or smell from far away, and some have rare abilities that no one knows. 
      
A hero called “the Mist” come seek for adventure and with helping hands in need. When there’s danger she always be there, from the sound of a flapping fly to the tallest waterfall, he can hear it all. For some, they called him a hero but some, called him a menace, both can be the truth and both can be the lies. But for him it’s only a phrase that wouldn’t be mind, only him can know about himself. 

One day, the Mist hear somebody’s scream in danger from far away, in a blinking light of dark he go after that sound. It sounds like a scream of a girl with dropping tears on her face with a big figure of shadow walking towards her with dangling sharp of a sword. The Mist quickly ambush that figure and a slow fight breaks in like an old wild west standoff. With eyes of the figure and the Mist stare each other with the girl sudden stop of crying and see both in the middle of their stare. And then the girl starts to cry again, with a blink of an eye a sudden feel of wind blows from the girl and sudden stops of her cry. Both the Mist and the Figure now on the opposite of their place. It seems the situation is fine with both just stops for a second. 

Then, one of both figures starts to fall and place to the ground while the other one survived with a standing pose but has some sudden scars in his body and face. Then that scared figure comes to the girl, with the girl afraid and wants to start cry again, the he reveals himself, it is the Mist! With a smile on his face. Then he gently touch the girl on her head and say “there there every going to fine.” And the girl stops crying and hugs the Mist then the Mist also hugs back the little girl. After that moment, the Mist wiping off the girl’s tears. Then, both start to stand up with holding hands and walk to the beautiful blue aura behind them with the figure helplessly lying down in the ground. 

After the Mist and the girl gone, a sudden move from the lying figure, is he still alive? Nobody knows except the sudden three figures just starring behind the helpless figure.
